<br/><br/>

## Supported Devices
 - Sound Blaster X-Fi Notebook
 - Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1
 - Sound Blaster X-Fi Go! (WIP)

<br/>

## Additional Features
 - 2ch Stereo Output for Sound Blaster X-Fi Notebook.
   - ![sbxnmodstereo](https://github.com/kgtmaven/SoundBlasterUSBAudioMod/assets/24592498/3a4771ca-9745-4942-b226-3a6d85878cb9)
   - Sound Blaster X-Fi Notebook originally only supports Virtual 5.1 Surround output. So there is a minor problem in some applications that only support 2ch Stereo. This driver solved this and added 2ch Stereo output.
     
 - Dolby Digital Live and DTS Connect Encoder.

   - Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 (not Pro) does not originally support DDL or DTS Connect. This driver supports these as additional features.

 - Sound Blaster X-Fi MB2
   - because newer KSAPO will conflict with Sound Blaster X-Fi Notebook.

 - THX TruStudio Pro
   - This is part of the Sound Blaster X-Fi MB2. so i implemented it together.
